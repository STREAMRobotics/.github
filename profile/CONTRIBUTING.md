# Best Practice Guide

To ensure consistency across all repositories in the STREAM Robotics Lab organization, please follow these naming conventions when creating new projects:

- **General rule**: use a clear and standardized prefix related to the main platform or project family.  
  - **Example:** for TurtleBot4 tutorials the repository name must be: turtlebot4_tutorials_'name'
 
## Commit-ing

When commiting to a repository, especially if you are working with other people you should follow the **conventional commits** format. More info here: [Conventional commit website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

This is the format:

```markdown
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

- Example -> docs: update UAV setup guide
